Install and Set Up kubectl
The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs. For a complete list of kubectl operations, see Overview of kubectl.

Before you begin

You must use a kubectl version that is within one minor version difference of your cluster. For example, a v1.2 client should work with v1.1, v1.2, and v1.3 master. Using the latest version of kubectl helps avoid unforeseen issues.

Install kubectl on Linux

Install kubectl binary with curl on Linux

Download the latest release with the command:

curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
To download a specific version, replace the $(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt) portion of the command with the specific version.

For example, to download version v1.19.0 on Linux, type:

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
Make the kubectl binary executable.

chmod +x ./kubectl
Move the binary in to your PATH.

sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:

kubectl version --client
Install using native package management

Ubuntu, Debian or HypriotOSCentOS, RHEL or Fedora

curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl"
To download a specific version, replace the $(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt) portion of the command with the specific version.

For example, to download version v1.19.0 on macOS, type:

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.0/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
Make the kubectl binary executable.

chmod +x ./kubectl
Move the binary in to your PATH.

sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:

kubectl version --client
Install with Homebrew on macOS

If you are on macOS and using Homebrew package manager, you can install kubectl with Homebrew.

Run the installation command:

brew install kubectl 
or

brew install kubernetes-cli
Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:

kubectl version --client
Install with Macports on macOS

If you are on macOS and using Macports package manager, you can install kubectl with Macports.

Run the installation command:

sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install kubectl
Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:

kubectl version --client
Install kubectl on Windows

Install kubectl binary with curl on Windows

Download the latest release v1.19.0 from this link.

Or if you have curl installed, use this command:

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.0/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe
To find out the latest stable version (for example, for scripting), take a look at https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt.

Add the binary in to your PATH.

Test to ensure the version of kubectl is the same as downloaded:

kubectl version --client
Note: Docker Desktop for Windows adds its own version of kubectl to PATH. If you have installed Docker Desktop before, you may need to place your PATH entry before the one added by the Docker Desktop installer or remove the Docker Desktop's kubectl.
Install with Powershell from PSGallery

If you are on Windows and using Powershell Gallery package manager, you can install and update kubectl with Powershell.

Run the installation commands (making sure to specify a DownloadLocation):

Install-Script -Name 'install-kubectl' -Scope CurrentUser -Force
install-kubectl.ps1 [-DownloadLocation <path>]
Note: If you do not specify a DownloadLocation, kubectl will be installed in the user's temp Directory.
The installer creates $HOME/.kube and instructs it to create a config file.

Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:

kubectl version --client
Note: Updating the installation is performed by rerunning the two commands listed in step 1.
