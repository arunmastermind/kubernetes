Linux:

Install kubectl
Make sure you have kubectl installed. You can install kubectl according to the instructions in Install and Set Up kubectl.

Install a Hypervisor
If you do not already have a hypervisor installed, install one of these now:

• KVM, which also uses QEMU

• VirtualBox

Minikube also supports a --driver=none option that runs the Kubernetes components on the host and not in a VM. Using this driver requires Docker and a Linux environment but not a hypervisor.

If you're using the none driver in Debian or a derivative, use the .deb packages for Docker rather than the snap package, which does not work with Minikube. You can download .deb packages from Docker.

Caution: The none VM driver can result in security and data loss issues. Before using --driver=none, consult this documentation for more information.
Minikube also supports a vm-driver=podman similar to the Docker driver. Podman run as superuser privilege (root user) is the best way to ensure that your containers have full access to any feature available on your system.

Caution: The podman driver requires running the containers as root because regular user accounts don't have full access to all operating system features that their containers might need to run.
Install Minikube using a package
There are experimental packages for Minikube available; you can find Linux (AMD64) packages from Minikube's releases page on GitHub.

Use your Linux's distribution's package tool to install a suitable package.

Install Minikube via direct download
